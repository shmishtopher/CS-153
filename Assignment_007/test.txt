It began one day in summer about thirty
years ago, and it happened 
to four children.
 Jane was the oldest (14) and Mark (12)
was the only boy,
and between them they ran everything. Katharine (10)
was the middle girl, of docile disposition and a comfort to her mother.
She knew she was a comfort, and docile
because she had heard her mother say so.
